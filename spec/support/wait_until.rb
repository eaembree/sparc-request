class WaitUntilTimedOut < StandardError
end

# Wait up to the specified amount of time and return once the block
# returns a truthy (non-false, non-nil) value.
#
# Raises a WaitUntilTimedOut exception if the specified amount of time
# passes without the block returning a truthy value.
#
# If the block returns a truthy value, returns immediately.
#
# This method is similar to Capybara's old wait_until method (which was
# removed in Capybara 2.0).  This method should not be used in normal
# circumstances; use Capybara's matchers instead.  There are some cases
# where a Capybara matcher does not work or is inconvenient; this method
# is supplied for those cases.
